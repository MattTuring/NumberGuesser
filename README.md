# Welcome to Number Guesser!

#### A little bit about the project: It's the ULTIMATE CHALLENGER EDITION. Bring a close friend, but not too close because this game could ruin friendships. Pull up a seat and get ready to play.

Things that you can do:

* Start by updating the minimum and maximum range to change the default 1 to 100 range (make sure you enter a number and the min is not greater than the max).
* Create a name for each player (Only use alphanumeric characters). 
* Put your guesses in the guess box according to your player name (make sure to have the number be within the range and have it be an actual number).
* See if you won! Or.... continue to play. We will help let you know if you're too low or too high
* Reset Game - this will create a new number for you!
* Clear Game - this will clear anything that you've put into the inputs!
